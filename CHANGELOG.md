[Changes][v0.10.0]


<a name="v0.9.1"></a>
# [v0.9.1](https://github.com/gotson/komga/releases/tag/v0.9.1) - 18 Dec 2019

This release is focused on performance enhancements.

### Changes

- Hibernate lazy loading was not working because of Kotlin closed by default classes
- add Hibernate caches: second level, collections, query
- enhance code path to reduce number of database queries
- fix a bug where Series thumbnail would be retrieved by the first book in the collection, instead of the first by number
- remove (unused) bi-directional OneToOne relationship between Book and BookMetadata to reduce database fetch

[Changes][v0.9.1]


<a name="v0.9.0"></a>
# [v0.9.0](https://github.com/gotson/komga/releases/tag/v0.9.0) - 12 Dec 2019

### Features

- Web Interface enhancements (closes #18)
  - browse Libraries, Series, and Books
  - dashboard with recently added Series and Books
  - search Series and Books
  - remove browser pop-up for basic auth, use a dedicated login screen instead
  - http cache for static assets

### Changes

- retrieve real ip in audit logs (for example if behind a reverse proxy)
- remove Humio metrics
- libraries are sorted by name in the API by default

### Deprecation

- endpoints of the form `/series/{seriesId}/books/{bookId}/**`, use `/books/{bookId}/**` instead

### Known issues

- UI is extremely slow when browsing libraries/series with many items (75+) on Chrome Android

[Changes][v0.9.0]


<a name="v0.8.1"></a>
# [v0.8.1](https://github.com/gotson/komga/releases/tag/v0.8.1) - 05 Nov 2019

### Changes

- add metrics exporter for InfluxDB (disabled by default)

[Changes][v0.8.1]


<a name="v0.8.0"></a>
# [v0.8.0](https://github.com/gotson/komga/releases/tag/v0.8.0) - 30 Oct 2019

### Changes

- change docker base image to adoptopenjdk 11
- retrieve file size of books when scanning. Add file size in REST API and OPDS.

### Bug fixes

- Swagger is not showing Kotlin nullable types as optional (fixes #15)
- compare file modification time at millisecond. With JDK 9+ on Windows, time precision of the underlying clock would go over 6 digits, which is the precision of the timestamps in database, which would lead to loss of precision on saved timestamps, and failing comparisons of modification times at every library scan
- return only books in ready state via OPDS, else it would throw an error 500 because metadata is not ready
- prevent circular loop in the error resolver, which would complain in logs

[Changes][v0.8.0]


<a name="v0.7.1"></a>
# [v0.7.1](https://github.com/gotson/komga/releases/tag/v0.7.1) - 25 Oct 2019

### Bug fixes

- could not delete a library if it was specifically shared with any user

### Changes

- add build and git info in `/actuator/info` endpoint
- add `humio` metrics exporter (disabled, need to be enabled by configuration)

[Changes][v0.7.1]


<a name="v0.7.0"></a>
# [v0.7.0](https://github.com/gotson/komga/releases/tag/v0.7.0) - 22 Oct 2019

### :warning: Breaking changes

- `admin` and `user` users are deprecated and replaced by the User Management feature

### Features

- User management:
  - Automatic creation of an admin account at startup if no user exist in database, outputting the login and a random password in the logs
  - Ability to add/remove user accounts
  - Ability to manage roles: Admin/User
  - Ability to manage access to shared libraries per user
  - Ability for a user to change his/her password

### Changes

- OPDS entry links to file now include the full filename. This helps some (badly implemented) OPDS clients to correctly see the files.
- logs are written to disk, and available via the `/actuator/logfile` endpoint

### Bug fixes

- fix OPDS link for page streaming where an incorrect url escape in the `zero_based` query parameter would generate an error for the first page, shift all pages, and prevent the last page to be streamed

[Changes][v0.7.0]

- regenerate missing thumbnails on startup
- force one time regeneration of all thumbnails in this release to change the format of existing thumbnails

[Changes][v0.6.0]


<a name="v0.5.0"></a>
# [v0.5.0](https://github.com/gotson/komga/releases/tag/v0.5.0) - 10 Oct 2019

- Ability to exclude directories from disk scan, to be configured via `komga.libraries-scan-directory-exclusions` configuration key

**Deprecations**:

- The configuration property `komga.root-folder` is deprecated. Use the web interface to add libraries instead.
- The configuration property `komga.root-folder-scan-cron` is deprecated. It is replaced by `komga.libraries-scan-cron`.

# [v0.3.4](https://github.com/gotson/komga/releases/tag/v0.3.4) - 10 Sep 2019

the fix in v0.3.2 also increased the scan time, rolling back the change, and adding a one-time rescan to handle potential pdf files that were forgotten in mixed-content directories
subsequent addition of new supported file formats should force a rescan to ensure there are no missing files
